Together we can create a Mr. Potato Head using GitHub! 


### Directions
1. Find your teacher on github.com and find the `Mr_Potato_Head` repository:
2. Fork the Repo
3. Create a new workspace for this repository using the clone from Git URL from your repository.
4. Add your assigned body part to `potatohead.html`. Body parts can be found in the `assets` folder
5. Add the necessary CSS to your body part in the `potato.css` file.
6. Push your changes to your GitHub repo
7. Create a Pull request to your teacher's repo


## Remember: **Fork, Change, Push, Pull**

## Bonus:
Create a button that sits below Mr. Potato Head. When it is clicked, your body part will show and hide.
